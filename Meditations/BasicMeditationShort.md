# Chapter 56.1: Basic Meditation - Short Version
*[chaptermain]*


### ID p56-1
You can use the script below to lead yourself or others through a meditation. It begins with awareness of breath, which can be a complete practice on its own. 

## BasIc instructions
### ID p56-2
Sit in a comfortable but attentive posture, allowing your back to be straight but not rigid or stiff. Feel your head balanced on your shoulders, allow you face and jaw to relax, with arms and hands resting in a comfortable position.
### ID p56-3
Be attentive to whats happening within your own awareness, right here and right now, without judgment.
### ID p56-4
As you sit, begin to notice the ​sensations of breath. ​Pay attention for a moment to how your abdomen moves on each in-breath and out-breath, the movement of air through your nostrils, the slight movement of your chest and shoulders.
### ID p56-5
Find the spot in your body where the sensation of breathing is most vivid, whether it be your abdomen, your chest or your shoulders, or the movement of air through your nostrils. See how fully aware you can be of your whole cycle of breathing, recognizing that each part of the cycle is different from the other part.

### ID p56-6
You will notice your attention shifting away from the breath from time to time. It’s perfectly normal for thoughts to wander into fantasies, memories, worries, or things you need to do. When you notice your mind has wandered, try to meet it with a spirit of friendliness. You don’t need to ​do a​nything about it. There is nothing to ​fix​. Rather than forcing it, just try to allow yourself to become curious about what it’s like to be breathing right now, and you’ll find that the attention is naturally drawn back to the physical sensations of breath as it moves through your body.
### ID p56-7
Stay alert, relaxed, and above all, compassionate, as you maintain awareness of where the mind goes. Each time you notice the mind has been distracted or has wandered, gently shift your awareness back to sensations of breath.
### ID pause56-2
(​pause)

Notice the tendency to want to control your breathing. Let the quality of attention be light and easy, one of simply observing and noticing. You dont need to control the duration, intensity, pace, or the pause between each breath. Just be present.
### ID pause56-3
(​pause)

### ID p56-8
As this meditation comes to an end, recognize that you spent this time intentionally aware of your moment to moment experience. You are building the capacity for opening the senses to the vividness and aliveness of the present moment, and to recognize without judgement how your experience changes.
### ID p56-9
Then, when you're ready, allow your eyes to gently open and your attention to gently return to your surroundings.
