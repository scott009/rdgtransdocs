# Presentation Layer
## Description
- As the name implies, the presentation lay for the rdg translation project is concerned with how the material created in the deeper more  technically complex
and AI driven aspects of the project are presented to my fellow human beings.  There IS still a technical/ production side to this project layer.  Much of this focuses on how to effectively guide AI agents to quickly and effectively create human friendly interfaces (mostly web pages) 

## Detail

### Method
create a json file that is referenced from within jmaster
add a presentation object to jmaster/metadata  
 Understand that this Discusses the containers that HOuse Documents and not the documents themselves   
 this understanding is crucial 



Add a section to hold tranlations of document headings

. What are we writing today?  
##   What kind of Docuement
I want to create a web page  
It will be a simple html document that functions as the map to the existing content I've already generated. 
It will use my defulat sstyesheet  
I have already created the language files and can will supply valid links   
But I want to focus on text, on the message right now.

Stages   
  
  
Recovery Dharma is a living community of people supporting one another with honesty, compassion, and a shared wish to reduce suffering.   
  
The goal of this project is to create clear, accurate, and culturally grounded translations that help people feel welcomed and understood in their own language.   

We recognize a simple truth: recovery becomes more accessible when teachings are offered in the languages people use every day.


We would love to see a  close collaboration with  sanghas, monastics, translators, and recovery communities across the globe.  We hope these translations will open new doorways for connection, healing, and shared practice.  
  
our goal is to support printed editions, online materials, and community resources that meet people where they are, in the languages that feel most natural to them.
