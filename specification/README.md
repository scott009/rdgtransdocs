# Specification Layer

**Purpose:** Authoritative definitions of what the system is, what it does, and what constraints it operates under.

## What Belongs Here

- System specifications and behavior definitions
- What the system does and does not do
- Inputs, outputs, and constraints
- Architectural decisions and design patterns
- Data structures and schema definitions
- Non-negotiable system guarantees

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Narrative context or motivation
- Operational procedures or governance
- Instruction manuals or how-to guides
- Non-authoritative reasoning or exploration

## Relationship to Other Layers

- **Narrative:** Explains *why* the system exists
- **Operations:** Explains *how* work is performed
- **Specification:** Defines *what is true* about the system

Specification documents are authoritative. System behavior is defined here and nowhere else. Other documents may reference specifications, but do not contradict or redefine them.
