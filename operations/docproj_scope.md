# docproj-scope.md

## 1. PURPOSE

This document defines the **authoritative scope rules** for all documentation-project (docproj) enumeration and documentation inventory tasks within the **rdgtrans** project.

Its purpose is to:

- Eliminate repeated re-specification of scope, exclusions, and file-type rules across sessions
- Reduce cognitive overhead and ambiguity during verification
- Ensure deterministic, repeatable enumeration behavior across agents

This document applies to **enumeration and inventory only**. It does not authorize modification, synthesis, or locking of documentation artifacts.

## 2. INCLUSION / EXCLUSION RULES

### 2.1 In-Scope Directories

Unless explicitly excluded below, **all directories under `dochome/`** are in scope for documentation enumeration.

Enumeration means **listing documentation artifacts**, not interpreting or editing them.

### 2.1.1 Explicitly Included Directories

The following directories are confirmed **in-scope** and must be enumerated:

- `dochome/Reports/`
  - Rationale: Home for work-order changes, reports, and deliverables

- `dochome/execution_models/`
  - Rationale: Governance discussion artifacts; preserves flexibility for ongoing work

---

### 2.2 Explicitly Excluded Directories

The following directories are **always excluded** from docproj enumeration tasks:

- `dochome/archive/`
  - Rationale: Archived or deprecated material; not part of active documentation set

- `dochome/Meditations/`
  - Rationale: Content repository, not system or project documentation

- `dochome/supervisor_updates/`
  - Rationale: Ephemeral coordination artifacts; not canonical documentation

- **Image-only directories**
  - Defined as directories whose contents consist exclusively of image assets
    (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.svg`, `.webp`, `.gif`, etc.)
  - Rationale: Assets are not documentation artifacts

If a directory contains **any qualifying documentation file**, it is **not** considered image-only.

---

## 3. FILE TYPE PREFERENCES

### 3.1 Primary Documentation Files

The following file types constitute **documentation** and are enumerated by default:

- `.md` (Markdown) — **primary documentation format**

---

### 3.2 Metadata / Support Files — Excluded

The following file types are **metadata** and are **excluded from enumeration**:

- `vx.json` — Version-tracking files generated by local markdown editor
- Other `.json` files (schemas, manifests, metadata) — unless explicitly requested for a specific task
- `.yaml` / `.yml` — configuration or metadata
- `.txt` — unless explicitly requested

Rationale: These are supporting metadata, not documentation artifacts.

---

### 3.3 Excluded Asset Types

The following file types are **never considered documentation**:

- Image formats (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.svg`, `.webp`, `.gif`)
- Audio / video formats
- Binary formats

---

### 3.4 Edge Cases

- `vx.json` files are **always excluded**, even when located in otherwise in-scope directories
- `README.md` files in asset-oriented directories are **included**, unless the directory itself is explicitly excluded
- Mixed-content directories are evaluated file-by-file

---

## 4. CATEGORIZATION RULES

### 4.1 Documentation vs Assets vs Working Data

- **Documentation**: Markdown files intended to describe system purpose, process, or specification
- **Assets**: Images, media, or design resources
- **Working Data**: Temporary, analytical, or session-specific artifacts

Only **documentation** is enumerated by default.

---

### 4.2 Layer Assignment (Conceptual)

When relevant, documentation may be categorized conceptually as:

- **Narrative** — explains motivation or context
- **Operations** — defines process, coordination, or workflow (**authoritative on HOW**)
- **Specification** — defines system facts or structure (**authoritative on WHAT**)

Layer assignment is **descriptive**, not transformational, during enumeration.

---

## 5. AUTHORITY AND USAGE

- This document is **authoritative** for all docproj enumeration and documentation inventory tasks
- Any agent (ChatGPT, Claude Code, or human) performing enumeration **MUST follow these rules**
- Enumeration outputs must be consistent with this scope without additional clarification

**Note on Current Enumeration:**  
Locking this scope will require reconciliation of existing `documents.md` files to bring them into compliance:

- Remove `vx.json` entries from all layer inventories
- Remove `supervisor_updates/` entries from `operations/documents.md`
- Add `Reports/` entries
- Add `execution_models/` entries

### 5.1 Change Control

- Updates to this document require **explicit user approval**
- Changes to locked artifacts follow **git version control**
- Unlocking requires **explicit user authorization**

---

## 6. STATUS

- Layer: **Operations**
- State: **LOCKED**

This document is authoritative and may not be modified or reinterpreted without explicit user authorization.
