# Operations Layer

**Purpose:** Procedures, governance, and coordination for how work is performed and artifacts are produced, reviewed, and verified.

## What Belongs Here

- Work procedures and processes
- Governance and approval workflows
- How artifacts are produced and accepted
- Coordination protocols between agents and roles
- Audit and verification procedures
- Error handling and escalation rules

## What Does NOT Belong Here

- Project narrative or motivation
- System specifications or behavior definitions
- Non-authoritative reasoning or exploration
- Deterministic task instructions (those belong in Work Orders)

## Relationship to Other Layers

- **Narrative:** Explains *why* the system exists
- **Specification:** Defines *what is true* about the system
- **Operations:** Describes *how* work is performed and coordinated

**Governance Scope in Operations:** This layer defines *procedural governance*—how authority is exercised, decisions are coordinated, and work is approved in practice. Definitional authority (what is true about the system) remains explicitly in the Specification layer. Operations documents establish processes and boundaries; they do not define system behavior.

Operations documents point to processes; they do not replace detailed procedure documentation. They establish governance boundaries and coordination rules.

## Accepted Documents

See `documents.md` for the current inventory of accepted documents in this layer.
