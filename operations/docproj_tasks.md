# docproj Task Tracker

Current state tracking for documentation project (docproj) work. This document is intended to provide **lightweight, at-a-glance status** so that ChatGPT, Claude Code, and human contributors can immediately understand where the docproj effort stands at session start.

---

## Current State

- **docproj_scope.md**: LOCKED
- **docproj_tasks.md**: ACTIVE (living document)
- **cgptStart_docproj.md**: UPDATED (requires re-lock)
- **Enumeration reconciliation**: PENDING
- **Strategic roadmap**: PLANNED (Opus session)

---

## Completed

- [x] Create `docproj_scope.md` (authoritative scope rules for enumeration)
- [x] Create `docproj_tasks.md` (living task tracker)
- [x] Update `cgptStart_docproj.md` (add scope and tasks docs to initialization requirements)
- [x] Update `operations/documents.md` (add `docproj_scope.md` entry)
- [x] Remove versioned draft artifacts created during BANDY process (cleanup)
- [x] Clarify `docproj_tasks.md` status (working artifact, not locked, excluded from enumeration)

---

## In Progress

- [ ] None

---

## Next Session

- [ ] Create Opus manifest for strategic roadmap planning
  - Context: governance docs, current state, session accomplishments
  - Task: Complete docproj strategic roadmap and 2-day sprint plan
  - Optional: Bandy manifest with ChatGPT for refinement
  - Deliverable: Instruction set for Opus session

---

## Pending

- [ ] Execute Opus strategic planning session (after manifest created)

- [ ] Reconcile existing `documents.md` files to comply with `docproj_scope.md`:
  - Remove `vx.json` entries from all layer inventories
  - Remove `supervisor_updates/` entries from `operations/documents.md`
  - Add `Reports/` entries
  - Add `execution_models/` entries

---

## Notes on Timing

**Doubled token budget window:** Now through 2025-12-31 (2 days)
- Prioritize high-value work during this window
- Strategic roadmap helps maximize efficiency

---

**Notes:**
- This tracker is intentionally lightweight and non-authoritative.
- It reflects *current working state*, not historical record.
- Git history remains the source of truth for change provenance.

**File Status:** Working artifact, intentionally excluded from documents.md enumeration. This file is scaffolding for docproj construction, not part of the permanent documentation system. **Not locked** — updated each session as tasks progress.
