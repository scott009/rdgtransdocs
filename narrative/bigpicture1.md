# Project Backstory: Recovery Dharma Global (RDG) Asian Translation Project

**Status:** Strategic Overview & Repository Alignment
**Administrator:** Scott009 (RDG Global)
**Core Mission:** Expanding the Buddhist-based recovery path to Asian regions, beginning with Thailand, through high-fidelity, multimodal translation of the primary RDG text.

## The High-Level Narrative (The 1500-Foot View)

Recovery Dharma Global (RDG) is a non-profit organization utilizing Buddhist practices and principles to support recovery from addiction. Historically, RDG has lacked a physical or translated presence in the Asian regions where Buddhism originated.

The project was catalyzed when a contact in Thailand reached out via official channels inquiring about Thai translations of the Recovery Dharma book. As the administrator, I recognized this as a critical opportunity to bring the "Dharma of Recovery" back to its geographical roots.

### The Source of Truth

The Recovery Dharma book serves as the semi-authoritative "Source of Truth" for this project. It is the anchor for all tasks. While specific administrative deviations from the text may exist for strategic reasons, the book remains the content foundation for all repositories.

### Project Evolution: The Four Tasks

The project has moved through four distinct phases of implementation, evolving from raw text to structured, multimodal "containers."

#### Task 1: Structural Transformation

**The Problem:** The original source was a "problem-ridden" Microsoft Word file lacking the structure necessary for modern digital workflows.

**The Action:** A significant manual and technical effort was undertaken to transform the Word file into a structured, human-editor-friendly format.

**The Result:** RDGBook_English.md.

**Design Choice:** Eliminating non-structural elements to ensure the document focused purely on content integrity.

#### Task 2: Multilingual Translation

**The Agent:** Claude (Anthropic) was selected as the primary translation agent.

**The Strategy:** Leveraging the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform parallel translations into multiple Asian languages simultaneously.

**The Result:** The multilingual masters found in the /lmasters directory.

#### Task 3: Audio Production (Spoken Versions)

**The Agent:** Azure AI Speech was chosen for its optimal balance of high-quality neural voices and cost-efficiency.

**The Scope:** Initial efforts have focused on converting a small, high-impact section of the book into spoken versions to test the fidelity of the "Spoken Dharma."
